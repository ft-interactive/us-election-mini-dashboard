# us-election-mini-dashboard (prototype)

Aim:

- make a quick prototype for developing the 4 live data panels for the homepage (president, senate, house, markets) at various sizes

- focus on the static version first, i.e. no clientside JS, just show all sections one after the other. (later some clientside JS will convert it to tabs and set up the auto-rotate logic.)


## Development

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

## Notes

- there is also going to be a 'markets' panel containing inline SVGs, but this will be added with clientside javascript only.
